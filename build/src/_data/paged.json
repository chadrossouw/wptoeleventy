The purchase of this ticket by you from the authorised ticket agent See Tickets, entitles You to gain entry to the Fireworks Festival staged by Alexandra Park and Palace Charitable Trust  at the venue Alexandra Palace and Park advertised. Only customers holding a valid Ticket will be admitted to the Event. Your Ticket may be invalidated if any part of it is removed, altered or defaced.</p><p>2. This Ticket is issued subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, as well as those published by Ticket Agent on their respective websites. Purchase of any Ticket constitutes acceptance of these Terms and Conditions on Your behalf and on behalf of any person for whom you are purchasing Tickets. In the event of any inconsistency between these Terms and Conditions and those of the Venue or the Ticket Agent, these terms and conditions stated on this website shall prevail.</p><p>3. The Terms and Conditions are subject to change from time to time without notice and at our discretion. We will notify you of amendments to the Terms and Conditions by posting them to this website (www.fireworks.london).</p><p>4. Please check Tickets carefully as errors cannot always be rectified following purchase. Tickets are not issued on a sale or return basis and refunds will not be made on returned Tickets unless otherwise provided under the Terms and Conditions.</p><p>5. The Organiser is not responsible for any Ticket that is lost, stolen or destroyed. You are solely responsible for the safety of Your Ticket. It is not always possible to issue duplicate Tickets. If duplicate Tickets are issued, a reasonable and appropriate administration fee may be charged.</p><p>6. Tickets are non-refundable except if the event is cancelled. The Organiser will not be liable to you for failure to perform any obligation under these terms and conditions if the failure is caused by Force Majeure i.e any forces beyond the Organiser’s control. For the purposes of these terms and conditions, Force Majeure covers, without limitation, an act of God, war, insurrection, riot, civil disturbances, acts of terrorism (or the threat thereof), strike, fire, explosion, flood, royal mourning, national mourning, theft of essential equipment, malicious damage, lock out, weather (including but not limited to high winds), third party injunction, national defence requirements and/or acts or regulations of national or local governments.</p><p>7. Purchase or possession of a Ticket does not confer any rights (by implication or otherwise) on You to use, alter, copy, or otherwise deal with any of the symbols, trademarks, logos and/or intellectual property appearing on the Ticket.</p><p>8. Neither the Venue nor the Organiser nor the Ticket Agent shall have any further liability beyond the face value of the Ticket purchased plus the relevant per ticket booking fee.</p><p>9. In the event of a cancellation, postponement or Material Alteration of the Event (defined below) You will be entitled to a refund in accordance with the terms and conditions or refund policy of the authorised Ticket Agent from whom You purchased a Ticket. Where the cancellation takes place part-way through an Event, at the discretion of the Organiser, You may only be entitled to a partial refund of the face price Ticket value. Personal arrangements including travel, subsistence and accommodation in relation to the Event which have been arranged by You are made at Your own risk and neither the authorised Ticket Agent nor the Organiser will have any liability for any such loss of enjoyment or wasted expenditure. Material Alteration is a change which in our reasonable opinion makes the Event materially different to the Event which purchasers of the Ticket could reasonably expect. Changes to performance times, acts and performers/participants shall not be considered a Material Alteration and the Organiser will not be liable for such changes. A Material Alteration is judged by reference to the nature, form and billing of the Event. The Event is judged and valued by reference to the overall theme rather than any individual act, performer or participant scheduled to appear. No scheduled acts may be considered as headline acts, regardless of their relative fame or prominence in the billing. Hence cancellation by an artist will not entitle You to a refund, regardless of their position on the bill.</p><p>10. In the event that You are entitled to a refund, please refer to the terms and conditions of the authorised Ticket Agent from which You purchased Your Ticket for details of how to claim that refund. You may not be entitled to obtain a refund if You fail to follow the instructions provided within the notified time frames. Refunds will only be made to the person who purchased the Ticket(s).</p><p>11. It is Your responsibility to check that the Event has not been cancelled, rescheduled or made the subject of a Material Alteration. Information on such matters will be made available on behalf of the Organiser as soon as reasonably practicable on the Event website and/or at the Venue. Customers are advised that the website cannot always be updated immediately and that circumstances giving rise to cancellation, postponement or Material Alterations can sometimes arise at late notice or immediately prior to an Event.</p><p>12. Tickets will not be refunded once they have been used to gain entry to the Event, or where You are given the option to attend a postponed Event on an alternative date.</p><p>13. Tickets are personal revocable licenses and shall at all times remain the property of the Organiser and subject to these Terms and Conditions. You may not re-sell or transfer a Ticket for commercial gain. If a Ticket is re-sold, transferred or advertised for profit or commercial gain or used for competitions, promotions or hospitality packages by anyone other than the organiser, or an authorised sub-agent, it will be void and You will be refused entry to, or ejected from, the Venue without refund. Should You re-sell a Ticket to a third party you may find that the third party brings a legal claim against You for selling a Ticket which does not permit access to the Event. The organiser reserves the right to cancel any Ticket booking which it reasonably believes to have been made with a view to re-sell Tickets or where the Ticket has been purchased using fraudulent means, including credit card fraud.</p><p>14. Tickets may be restricted to a maximum number per person per credit card or per household. These restrictions will be notified to you by the Ticket Agent before you make your booking. The Organiser reserves the right to cancel Tickets purchased in excess of this number without prior notification to you of such cancellation.</p><p>15. This is at least in part an outdoor event and, as with all action sports and music events, performance is subject to the prevailing weather conditions. In the event that it is deemed unsafe for any scheduled display, event or activities to take place the Organiser may reschedule the Event or cancel it in its entirety. As per clause 8 above, if the Event is cancelled entirely, the Organiser shall refund the face value price of the Ticket. If part of the Event is cancelled, i.e. the firework display itself, the Organiser may refund some or all of the purchase price of the Firework Ticket in its absolute discretion, but shall be under no obligation to do so. In this instance the beer festival and Ice rink ticket will still be valid and non-refundable.</p><p>16.
